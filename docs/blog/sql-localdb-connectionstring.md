I can never remember that connectionstring for localdb on SQLServer. The thing about localdb is that it just works. And ef core will create the db on the fly when running `context.Database.Migrate();` if it doesn't already exist. This means happy times when you are doing a fresh clone ðŸ˜„

```
"Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=Company.Application.NameOfDb;Trusted_Connection=True;"
```

This "blog" is basically a place for reminders like these. However small and stupid.
