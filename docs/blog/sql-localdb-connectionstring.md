# SQL Server local db connection string
I can never remember that connectionstring for localdb on SQLServer. The thing about localdb is that it just works, no setup required. And ef core will create the db on the fly when running `context.Database.Migrate();` if it doesn't already exist. This means happy times when you are doing a fresh clone ðŸ˜„

```
"Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=Company.Application.NameOfDb;Trusted_Connection=True;"
```

This "blog" is basically a place for reminders like these. However small and stupid.
