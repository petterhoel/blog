# SQL Server local db

I can never remember that connectionstring for localdb on SQLServer. localdb justs works and ef core will create the db on the fly when runnung migrate if it doesn't already exist. Happy times when you are doing a fresh clone ðŸ˜„

```
"Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=WhateverCompany.WhateverApplication.WhateverDb;Trusted_Connection=True;"
```

This "blog" is basically a place for reminders like these. However small and stupid.
