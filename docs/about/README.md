**_The bits and the pixels_** – there is so much to them. 

**_UX, performace, security_** – working together. 

This is a place for reminders and thoughts on whatever I come across as a developer that makes me wanna permalink it.

Communication is the most important skill for any developer. _Do no harm_ is the mantra. Big improvements come in tiny steps. 

**_whoami_**  I tease the cat, walk the dog, do my asanas - enjoy music, food and coffee. I also work as a web developer and I live in Oslo. My name is Petter Hoel.
