# What is this then?

**The bits and the pixels** – there is so much to them...

**UX, performace, security** – working together. Getting the tech right can be hard enough.

However I find communication is the most important skill for _any_ developer. _Do no harm_ is my mantra. I try hard to apply it to all facets of my life. Big improvements come in tiny steps.

**whoami**  I tease the cat, sometimes pluck a guitar string – enjoy music, food and coffee. I also work as a web developer and I live in Oslo. My name is Petter Hoel.

This is a place for reminders and thoughts on whatever I come across as a developer that makes me wanna permalink it.
