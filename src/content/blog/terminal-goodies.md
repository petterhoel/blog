# Terminal goodies - Awesome 🤩, but forgettable 🕸


I like the terminal but I'm no 🐱‍👤 These things are so forgetable to me because I don't use them quite often enough 🙄
## Open bash file in VS code.
```
code ~/.bashrc
```

## Aliases are handy
```
alias prjctabrv='cd /c/source/project/path'
alias src='cd /c/source'
alias fixweb='rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm i'
alias runweb='npm run start'
alias buildweb='npm run build -- --prod'
```
