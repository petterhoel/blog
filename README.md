# bits && pixels blog

this is a personal place for reminders and thoughts on whatever I come across as a developer that I find reassuring to have a permalink for. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
you need to have yarn or npm on your machine
```

### Installing

Clone this repo
```
> git clone https://github.com/petterhoel/blog.git
```
Change directory
```
> cd blog
```

Spin up the dev server

```
> yarn docs:dev 
```

## Running the tests

```
i'm sorry but our tests are at another castle
```

## Deployment [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/fcee5757-7d0e-43e6-b441-28bd554805ba/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/gallant-mahavira-2e103d/deploys)
A merge to master will deploy _this_ site. 

If you are using this as a starter for your own project you wanna run 

```
> yarn docs:build
``` 

That will create all the static files for your site and place them in ```docs/.vuepress/dist```. Copy these files to your sites root folder. 

This projects uses [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for that. They make it real simple.
