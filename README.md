This is a place for reminders and thoughts on whatever I come across as a developer that I find reassuring to have a permalink for.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need [npm](https://nodejs.org/) on your machine, an evergreen browser and preferably your favorite text edtior 🤓 

### Installing

Clone this repo
```
> git clone https://github.com/petterhoel/blog.git
```
Change directory
```
> cd blog
```

Install dependencies
```
> npm install
```

Spin up the dev server

```
> npm run docs:dev 
```
navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Running the tests

```
thank you for playing! but our tests are in another castle
```

## Deployment
A merge to master will deploy _this_ site. 

If you are using this as a starter for your own project you wanna run 

```
> npx vuepress build
``` 

That will create all the static files for your site and place them in ```.vuepress/dist```. Copy these files to your sites root folder. 

This projects uses [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) for that.
